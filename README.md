* Official Github : https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq

## Requirements
Please see requirements.txt

## Usage
* notebooks/preparation.ipynb 
for downloading dataset, making some directories etc.

* notebooks/code2seq.ipynb
for training and evaluating the model.

## Memo
* Beam search is not implemented.
